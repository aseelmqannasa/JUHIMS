        This project came from the need to develop and make it easier for the employees at the University of Jordan to connect with the health insurance company and department at the University of Jordan.
        Health Insurance Management System is a system that aims to design, develop and evaluate a health insurance system that can be used by the health insurance department in the University of Jordan.
        It enables the user to communicate with his/her insurance company, find health providers (clinics, hospitals, pharmacies, …etc.) included in the insurance plan, renew or cancel subscription, add beneficiaries and replace every paper transaction with a digital easy transaction that can be used by any user with any technical experience.
